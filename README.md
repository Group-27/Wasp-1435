### General App Attributes

- Mobile: Offers a text based forum, to allow users to ask for advice on particular puzzle problem. 

- Story: The App name is inspired by `Cicada 3301`. Cicada was an internet puzzle that was first started on January 4th and ran for three years to collect very intelligent individuals. `Wasp 1435` aims to brings smart and creative people together with puzzle solving and encourage others to participate, by simulating problem-solving activities found at security/hacking conferences. 

- Market: People who like sudoku/chess, like to be challenged, tired of candy crush, and wants a brain teaser. Considering that there will be a future option to meet other users of the app, users must be 18 and above in order to activate this functionality. 

- Habit: Solving a puzzle can span a week or a month depending on difficulty and the number of stages to pass. Roughly about weekly usage. Future option would be to have users provide ideas/suggestions and/or allow users create their entire puzzle (similar to a quest) for other users solve by submitting a proposal to the app.

- Scope: puzzle creation would take a good amount of time. Will require ads for source of income to continuously curate and develop puzzles and/or sponsorships as a source of events. A way to manage or deploy weekly and monthly puzzles, will need to be considered. A stripped-down version of this app is still interesting to build. 

NOTE: the word `puzzle(s)` can be interchangeably used with the word `quest`.
